Recon@@ nec@@ ting With the V@@ ery American I@@ deal That Labor Rights Are Human Rights <EOS> <BOS> Con@@ gressmen Ke@@ ith Elli@@ son and John Le@@ w@@ is have proposed legislation to protect union organizing as a civil right . <EOS> <BOS> " As go unions , so go middle @-@ class jobs , " says Elli@@ son , the Min@@ ne@@ so@@ ta Democrat who serves as a Congressional Progressive Cauc@@ us co @-@ chair . <EOS> <BOS> That 's why I 'm proud to introduce the Emp@@ lo@@ yee Em@@ powerment Act with civil rights icon John Le@@ w@@ is . <EOS> <BOS> This ground @-@ breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options for union organizing discrimination as for other forms of discrimination - stopping anti @-@ union forces in their tracks <EOS> <BOS> Am@@ ending the National Labor Relations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for engaging in union organizing to sue for justice in the civil courts - and to collect compens@@ atory and punitive damages - is a sound and necessary initiative . <EOS> <BOS> But it in certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards . <EOS> <BOS> Indeed , the best way to understand what Elli@@ son , Le@@ w@@ is and the co@@ sponsors of their legislation are proposing is as a re@@ connection with a very American idea . <EOS> <BOS> Despite the bat@@ tering that unions have taken in recent years - in Wis@@ con@@ sin , Michigan and states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to embrace , extend and respect labor rights . <EOS> <BOS> There was a time , within the living memory of millions of Americans , when this country championed democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right to organize in the same breath . <EOS> <BOS> When the United States occupied Japan after World War II , General Dou@@ gl@@ as Mac@@ Arthur and his aides encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to assure that H@@ ide@@ ki To@@ jo 's militarized autocracy would be replaced with democracy . <EOS> <BOS> F@@ ully aware that workers and their unions had a role to play in shaping the new Japan , they included language that explicitly recognized that " the right of workers to organize and to bargain and act collectively is guaranteed . " <EOS> <BOS> When the United States occupied Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides urged the Germans to write a constitution that would assure that Adolf Hitler 's fascism was replaced with muscular democracy . <EOS> <BOS> Recognizing that workers would need to organize and make their voices heard in the new nation , the Germans included a provision that explicitly declared : " The right to form associations to safeguard and improve working and economic conditions shall be guaranteed to every individual and to every occupation or profession . <EOS> <BOS> Agreements that restrict or seek to impair this right shall be n@@ ull and void ; measures directed to this end shall be unlawful . <EOS> <BOS> When former First Lady E@@ lean@@ or Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights , which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that would in 1948 be adopted by the United Nations as a global co@@ venant , Roosevelt and the dra@@ f@@ ters included a guarantee that " everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests . " <EOS> <BOS> For generations , Americans accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights . <EOS> <BOS> When this country counsel@@ ed other countries on how to forge civil and democratic societies , Americans explained that the right to organize a trade union - and to have that trade union engage in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies - had to be protected . <EOS> <BOS> Now , with those rights under assault in America , it is wise , indeed , to recomm@@ it to the American ideal that working people must have a right to organize and to make their voices heard in a free and open society . <EOS> <BOS> As the Re@@ ve@@ ren@@ d Martin Luther King J@@ r. said fifty years ago :
History is a great teacher . <EOS> <BOS> Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not diminish the strength of the nation but enlarged it . <EOS> <BOS> By raising the living standards of millions , labor miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to und@@ re@@ amed of levels of production . <EOS> <BOS> Those who attack labor forget these simple truths , but history remembers them . <EOS> <BOS> History remembers , as should we . <EOS> <BOS> The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against labor organizing - is long overdue . <EOS> <BOS> Ke@@ ith Elli@@ son and John Le@@ w@@ is are renewing ideals that have historically enlarged America and made real the promise of democracy .
Judge temporarily blocks law that could close all Louisiana abortion clinics <EOS> <BOS> A U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked enforcement of a Louisiana law that advocates say would likely have closed all five abortion clinics in the state . <EOS> <BOS> The measure , signed into law by Louisiana Governor B@@ ob@@ by J@@ ind@@ al in June and due to take effect S@@ ep@@ t . 1 , would require doctors who perform abor@@ tions to have patient admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice . <EOS> <BOS> However , the judge 's ruling means that for the time being doctors can continue to perform legal abor@@ tions while seeking such privileges . <EOS> <BOS> " Pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs will be allowed to operate law@@ fully while continuing their efforts to obtain privileges , " Federal Judge John de@@ Gra@@ vel@@ les wrote in the decision . <EOS> <BOS> A hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judge to make a more permanent ruling on the law . <EOS> <BOS> A@@ bor@@ tion rights activists applauded the decision , the latest in a string of rulings against similar measures , saying it would give doctors more time to seek hospital privileges . <EOS> <BOS> " Today 's ruling ensures Louisiana women are safe from an under@@ handed law that seeks to strip them of their health and rights , " said Nancy Nor@@ th@@ up , president and chief executive of the Center for Re@@ productive Rights , which sued to block the law on behalf of three of the state 's five clinics . <EOS> <BOS> It was not immediately clear whether the ruling applied to doctors from the two clinics who were not plaintiffs in the suit and have also applied for admitting privileges . <EOS> <BOS> Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws , with courts recently ruling unconstitutional such measures in Al@@ ab@@ ama and Mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i . <EOS> <BOS> Key parts of a Texas law that would have shut@@ tered most remaining clinics in that state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday . <EOS> <BOS> A@@ bor@@ tion rights campaigners , along with the American College of Ob@@ ste@@ tri@@ cians and Gy@@ nec@@ ologists and the American Medical Association , say admitting privileges laws impose medic@@ ally unnecessary requirements on doctors . <EOS> <BOS> Anti @-@ abortion advocates have countered that the measures aim to protect women 's health , though some have also lauded their effect of shut@@ tering clinics . <EOS> <BOS> Only one doctor who performs abor@@ tions in Louisiana has hospital admitting privileges , the Center for Re@@ productive Rights said . <EOS> <BOS> If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abor@@ tions , that doctor , fearful for his safety , would stop carrying out the procedure , the group said . <EOS> <BOS> In arguing against the ruling , Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors performing abor@@ tions while their applications for admitting privileges were pending .
Del@@ a@@ yed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment mean ovarian cancer kills more in rural areas <EOS> <BOS> Angel@@ ina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their late mother who died of O@@ v@@ arian cancer in 2007 . <EOS> <BOS> Women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their city counterparts . <EOS> <BOS> Researchers analy@@ sed medical records of more than 1@@ 100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 , finding just 35 per cent lived for five years after diagnosis . <EOS> <BOS> Lead researcher Susan Jordan , of the Q@@ IM@@ R Ber@@ gh@@ of@@ er Medical Research Institute , said those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas . <EOS> <BOS> SM@@ AL@@ L ST@@ U@@ D@@ Y : New drugs may slow lung , ovarian cancer <EOS> <BOS> The researchers tracked the women 's medical jour@@ neys across seven years . <EOS> <BOS> D@@ r Jordan said a woman 's age at the time of diagnosis , ovarian cancer type , having existing illnesses and socio @-@ economic status also imp@@ acted on survival chances . <EOS> <BOS> Ol@@ der women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagnosis had the poorest survival rates . <EOS> <BOS> Those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas . <EOS> <BOS> Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer , D@@ r Jordan suggested delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment might be factors . <EOS> <BOS> " This disease is best treated by gy@@ na@@ ecological on@@ co@@ logy surge@@ ons and they 're mostly based in major cities , " she said . <EOS> <BOS> Despite improving te@@ le @-@ medicine services to lessen the tyranny of distance , she suggested more fly @-@ in , fly @-@ out services to allow specialists to treat women closer to home and programs to support people in treatment away from their communities could help . <EOS> <BOS> D@@ r Jordan said regardless of geographical status , the study found long @-@ term survival among women with ovarian cancer was poor , reinforcing the need for better treatment and prevention strategies . <EOS> <BOS> The research , funded by the Rio T@@ into R@@ ide to Con@@ qu@@ er cancer , will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia . <EOS> <BOS> In March 2012 , at 33 years of age , young Gold Coast m@@ um Eli@@ sh@@ a N@@ ea@@ ve was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer .
Gar@@ den cent@@ res ru@@ e fall in homeowners <EOS> <BOS> The drop , coupled with a particular decline in the number of homeowners aged under 35 , could result in gar@@ den cent@@ res losing out on tens of millions of pounds a year when today 's young consumers reach the " core gar@@ dening age group , " according to the H@@ TA 's study , which was reported by the Financial Times . <EOS> <BOS> According to the report , people ren@@ ting properties spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that those with their own homes spend on their gar@@ dens . <EOS> <BOS> It cited the rise in people living in highly urban@@ ised areas with no gar@@ dens , the popularity of paving over front gar@@ dens for parking and shrinking gar@@ den size as other factors threatening the industry , which is worth an estimated £ 5 billion in sales each year . <EOS> <BOS> Greater London , where home ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years , has Britain 's lowest spend per household on gar@@ dening products . <EOS> <BOS> The H@@ TA and Royal Hor@@ ticul@@ tural Society said that ren@@ ting property or a lack of gar@@ den space did not mean people could not grow plants . <EOS> <BOS> Gu@@ y Bar@@ ter , chief hor@@ ticul@@ tural adviser to the R@@ H@@ S , said : " Con@@ tain@@ er gar@@ dening , for example , is especially popular with ren@@ ters who can move their plants when they relocate .
